| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| `domain_analyzer.py`      | Gathers intelligence on a domain, including IP, WHOIS, and MX records.       | `whois`, `dns.resolver` |
| `virustotal_checker.py` | Checks a URL's reputation using the VirusTotal API.                        | `requests`           |
| `file_checksum.py`      | Generates MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes to verify file integrity.             | `hashlib`            |
| `password_strength.py`  | Evaluates a password's strength based on length, complexity, and patterns.   | (standard libraries) |
| `port_quiz.py`          | An interactive command-line game to help memorize network ports and services. | `random`             |

    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your API Key (for `virustotal_checker.py`):**
    -   Create a file named `api_keys.py`.
    -   Inside the file, add your VirusTotal API key like this:

        ```
        VT_API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key_here'
        ```
